* Improvement: Customized `angle-*` solid FontAwesome icons to be thinner; this gets the main navigation submenu indicator icons looking more how they did previously.
* Improvement: When using the [Theme Blvd Shortcodes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-blvd-shortcodes/) plugin, the "Add Shortcode" button has been added to the new framework rich-text editors, used in the layout builder.

* Fixed: Text logo not centering when "Center Logo" is checked with Super User and Executive bases.
* Fixed: "Delete All Icons" button not working when configuring contact links.

* Theme Code Overhaul
	* All PHP code now meets [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards).
	* All function, action, and filter comments now meet WordPress's [PHP Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php).
	* All template part files were moved from the theme root to a `template-parts` directory; **if using any template parts in your child theme, make sure you also move these into a `template-parts` directory!**
	* New template parts added, that can be copied to your child theme:
		* `/template-parts/content-head.php` -- Edit the website `<head>`.
		* `/template-parts/content-header.php` -- Edit the desktop website header content.
		* `/template-parts/content-mobile-header.php` -- Edit the mobile website header content.
		* `/template-parts/content-sticky-header.php` -- Edit the sticky header content.
		* `/template-parts/content-footer.php` -- Edit the website footer.
		* `/template-parts/content-panel.php` -- Edit desktop side panel content.
		* `/template-parts/content-mobile-panel.php` -- Edit the mobile menu panel content.
	* Template part files `content-template_archives.php` and `content-template_sitemap.php` were renamed to `content-template-archives.php` and `content-template-sitemap.php`.
	* Mobile header is now a completely separate component from the desktop header.
	* Sticky header and mobile panel content can now be edited through template parts and/or action hooks; they no longer rely solely on JavaScript to be built.
	* Use of `themeblvd_get_part()` now deprecated; all instances of `get_template_part()` replaced with new `themeblvd_get_template_part()` wrapper function; all previous, related filters have remained in place and work as before.
	* Re-structured all admin CSS and JavaScript for better organization and efficiency.
	* The "Agent" theme base’s footer has become the default website footer across all theme bases. This means there’s new CSS applied to the footer in all other theme bases. And for the “Agent” base, it means that it has default framework functions hooked for the footer content.
	* Your [custom layout builder elements](http://dev.themeblvd.com/tutorial/add-custom-builder-elements/) are now hooked to an action `themeblvd_element_{$type}` instead of just `themeblvd_{$type}`, to not conflict with filtering standard output of elements.
	* Deprecated the function `themeblvd_responsive_menu_toggle()`; use function `themeblvd_mobile_panel_trigger()` instead.
	* Added various security improvements.
	* Added action hooks `themeblvd_header` and `themeblvd_footer`, giving you control over these entire sections at the top-level. All previous actions hooks still exist within (except `themeblvd_header_above`).
	* Added filter to remove frontend debug info from printing in source code; just filter `themeblvd_do_debug_info` to return `false`.
	* Added filter to remove admin framework welcome message; just filter `themeblvd_do_welcome_message` to `false`.
	* Added filter `themeblvd_sidebar_args` added, which is shared with Theme Blvd Widget Areas plugin; this filters arguments passed to `register_sidebar()` for custom and theme widget areas.
	* Added filter `themeblvd_element_{$type}_options` to modify options for any element being outputted from the layout builder.
	* Added filter `themeblvd_element_{$type}_display` to modify display options for any element being outputted from the layout builder.
	* Added additional CSS classes to contact buttons and social sharing buttons, for more complex styling possibilities.
	* Added improved script and stylesheet debugging, when WordPress's `SCRIPT_DEBUG` constant is set to `true`.
	* Added `alt` tags to parallax background image HTML output from the layout builder; you must re-insert and save your background image for the `alt` tags to start outputting.
	* Removed all "fancy selects" styling on admin UI select menus; we're now relying on default WordPress styling.
	* Removed overly complex stylesheet API; all framework CSS files now enqueued through simple, pluggable function `themeblvd_include_styles()`.
	* Removed old html5shiv for HTML5 compatibility with IE8.
	* Removed `themeblvd_featured_*` action hooks, which were deprecated in framework 2.5.
	* Removed `responsiveness` from the global configuration; it's now assumed that your site will always be responsive.
	* Removed `themeblvd_viewport_default()` function, that was hooked to `wp_head`; now you can just edit `content-head.php` instead.
	* Removed the deprecated action hook, `themeblvd_header_above`; use `themeblvd_header_content` or `themeblvd_header_top` instead.
	* Removed the filter `themeblvd_featured_thumb_frame` to add old Bootstrap thumbnail border to images; use CSS customization instead.
	* Optimized (minified) CSS file included on frontend for each theme base.
