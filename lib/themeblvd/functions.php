 * Include Theme Blvd WordPress framework.

 * Below is the file needed to load the parent theme and
 * theme framework. It's included with require_once() so
 * that it can be included via a child theme without having
 * to worry about duplicate inclusion.
 *
 * So, if you're creating a child theme, this line needs to
 * be at the top of your child theme's functions.php. By doing
 * this you're overriding the file being included here.
